                <h3>Introduction to Web Development</h3>
                <p>The IDEAS program began with a comprehensive introduction to web development. We are covering the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, laying a strong foundation for building interactive and responsive web pages. This initial phase is crucial in developing an understanding of web technologies and their applications.</p>
                <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
                <p>Delving deeper into front-end development, I will learned how to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. This include mastering frameworks like Bootstrap and libraries such as React. These tools will enable me to build dynamic and responsive web applications that provide a seamless user experience.</p>
                <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
                <p>Transitioning to back-end development, where my aim is to gain proficiency in server-side technologies. Learning Node.js, Express, and MongoDB will allowed me to create robust and scalable web applications. This phase of the program will be emphasizing the importance of database management, server-side logic, and API development.</p>
                <h3>Full-Stack Projects</h3>
                <p>Applying my knowledge in real-world scenarios, I will be posted to work on several full-stack projects. These projects will be integrating both front-end and back-end technologies, providing a holistic view of web development. Each project being presented will come with its unique challenges and learning opportunities, enhancing my problem-solving skills and technical expertise.</p>
                <h3>Continuous Learning and Improvement</h3>
                <p>The IDEAS program is instilling a passion for continuous learning. Staying updated with the latest trends and technologies is essential in the ever-evolving tech industry. I regularly participate in workshops, attend webinars, and engage with the tech community to keep my skills sharp and relevant.</p>
